# 🧠 AIDE Defense v1  
### Autonomous Intelligence for Decision Evaluation (Advisory Only)

---

## Overview

**AIDE Defense v1** is a human-in-the-loop **strategic decision intelligence system** designed to help policymakers, researchers, and institutions evaluate high-stakes decisions under uncertainty.

Rather than predicting outcomes or automating actions, AIDE Defense focuses on **how decisions propagate risk** across geopolitical, economic, and systemic dimensions — and whether those decisions remain robust when assumptions fail or are misinterpreted.

AIDE Defense is **not a weapon system**.  
It does not execute, command, or control any real-world operations.  
It exists solely to **support human judgment**.

## Core Problem

In national and global crises, failures rarely come from a lack of information.  
They arise from:

- Overconfidence in incomplete data  
- Ignoring second- and third-order effects  
- Misinterpretation of intent by adversaries  
- Fragile decisions that collapse under uncertainty  

AIDE Defense was built to address these exact failure modes.

## What AIDE Defense Does

AIDE Defense evaluates strategic decisions through multiple complementary lenses:

### 1. Decision-Centric Evaluation
- Accepts abstract decision vectors instead of commands
- Evaluates consequences without executing actions
- Keeps humans as the final authority

### 2. Escalation & Systemic Risk Modeling
- Models how escalation propagates across alliances and systems
- Surfaces indirect and second-order effects
- Integrates economic, disaster, and geopolitical stressors

### 3. Nuclear Miscalculation Risk (Decision-Level)
- Models risk arising from miscommunication and doctrine rigidity
- Does **not** model weapons, targeting, or force execution

### 4. Uncertainty & Confidence Awareness
- Quantifies uncertainty instead of hiding it
- Outputs confidence scores alongside every recommendation
- Refuses to recommend when confidence is insufficient

### 5. Robustness & Regret Analysis
- Stress-tests decisions under noise and assumption failure
- Identifies worst-case outcomes and volatility
- Highlights decisions that fail gracefully over those that optimize narrowly

### 6. Adversarial Misinterpretation Modeling
- Estimates how actions may be misunderstood by others
- Accounts for signaling ambiguity, doctrine mismatch, and media noise
- Explicitly flags misinterpretation as a core escalation driver

### 7. Hard Safety & STOP Conditions
- Automatically suspends recommendations when:
  - confidence is too low
  - nuclear miscalculation risk is high
  - misinterpretation risk exceeds thresholds
- Ensures ethical and governance boundaries are enforced

## Interfaces

### Jupyter Crisis Room (Research Interface)
- Interactive, notebook-based interface
- Live scenario evaluation
- Historical backtesting mode
- Executive summary views for decision comparison

The system is intentionally kept **non-deployed and non-real-time** in v1.

---

## Historical Backtesting (Signal-Level)

AIDE Defense v1 includes a historical backtesting mode using **abstracted signal profiles** (not classified or operational data).

This allows evaluation of whether the system would have flagged:
- rising instability
- insufficient confidence
- high misinterpretation risk  

during past crises — without replaying or simulating real operations.

---

## Explicit Boundaries (v1 Freeze)

AIDE Defense v1 **does not**:

- Control or command military assets  
- Automate or recommend force execution  
- Track or model individuals  
- Predict exact outcomes or timelines  
- Replace human judgment  

Any feature crossing these boundaries is **explicitly out of scope** for v1.

---

## Design Principles

AIDE Defense v1 is built on four non-negotiable principles:

1. **Uncertainty-aware, not certainty-driven**
2. **Robustness over optimization**
3. **Misinterpretation is more dangerous than intent**
4. **Human judgment remains sovereign**

---

## Intended Use

AIDE Defense v1 is intended for:

- Research and academic exploration  
- Policy analysis and scenario evaluation  
- Fellowship and institutional review  
- Ethical study of decision-making under uncertainty  

It is **not** intended for operational deployment.
